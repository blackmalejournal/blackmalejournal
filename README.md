## For the Admin (Non-Technical Operator)

The admin panel at `/admin` is a complete no-code CMS. You can:

- Write, edit, schedule, and publish all content types through the UI
- Upload cover images via drag-and-drop
- Manage members and subscriptions
- Handle contact form submissions
- Export subscriber lists
- Monitor editorial pipeline, audience metrics, and billing health

**Start here:** [Chairman Operator Manual](docs/ops/chairman-operator-manual.md)

## Emergency: If the Developer Is Unavailable

1. **The site runs itself.** Vercel auto-deploys from `main`. Supabase handles the database. Stripe handles billing. No manual intervention needed for day-to-day operations.

2. **Content management** is fully UI-driven via `/admin`. No code changes needed to publish, edit, or manage content.

3. **If something breaks:**
   - Check [docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for common fixes
   - Check Vercel dashboard for deployment status
   - Check Supabase dashboard for database health
   - Check Stripe dashboard for billing issues

4. **If you need a developer:**
   - This repo is a standard Next.js 16 app — any Next.js developer can work on it
   - All architecture decisions are documented in [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)
   - All conventions are in [docs/CONTRIBUTING.md](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md)
   - Environment setup takes ~10 minutes with [docs/DEVELOPER.md](docs/DEVELOPER.md)
