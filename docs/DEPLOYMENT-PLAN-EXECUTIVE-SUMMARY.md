- One-click rollback in Vercel Dashboard (2-3 minutes)
- Automatic health checks alert if issues detected

### Manual Rollback (Git)
```bash
# If needed, git revert to previous commit
git revert [commit-hash]
git push origin main
# Vercel automatically redeploys previous version
```

### Rollback SLA
- **Critical Issues:** Rollback within 15 minutes
- **High Severity:** Rollback within 30 minutes
- **Medium/Low:** Assess for hotfix vs rollback
