## Success Criteria

All criteria must be met for successful deployment:

| Criterion | Target | Acceptable Range |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| **Uptime** | 99.95% | > 99.9% |
| **Page Load (LCP)** | 2.1s | < 2.5s |
| **Error Rate** | < 0.1% | < 0.5% |
| **Lighthouse Score** | 92/100 | > 90/100 |
| **Critical Issues** | 0 | ≤ 1 (w/ mitigation) |
| **CSS Bundle Size** | +4KB gzipped | < 8KB |
| **Breaking Changes** | 0 | 0 (non-negotiable) |

---

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Browser Compatibility Issues
- **Probability:** Low (tested on 6 browsers)
- **Impact:** High (users can't see features)
- **Mitigation:** Extensive cross-browser testing, fallbacks for advanced features, rollback ready

### Risk 2: Performance Regression
- **Probability:** Low (CSS bundle +4KB acceptable)
- **Impact:** Medium (slower pages)
- **Mitigation:** Performance testing pre-deployment, monitoring post-deployment

### Risk 3: Mobile Rendering Issues
- **Probability:** Low (mobile-first design)
- **Impact:** Medium (mobile users affected)
- **Mitigation:** Mobile device testing, responsive design validation

### Risk 4: Accessibility Compliance Failure
- **Probability:** Low (WCAG AA verified)
- **Impact:** High (accessibility lawsuit risk)
- **Mitigation:** Lighthouse audit, screen reader testing, keyboard navigation tests

### Risk 5: Animation Performance on Low-End Devices
- **Probability:** Medium (animations heavy)
- **Impact:** Medium (user experience degraded)
- **Mitigation:** GPU acceleration, reduced motion support, performance profiling

**Mitigation Summary:** All risks have documented mitigation strategies and rollback plans.

---

## Rollback Strategy

### Automatic Rollback
- Vercel keeps previous deployments available
- Automatic health checks trigger alerts if issues detected
- One-click rollback via Vercel Dashboard (2-3 min to previous version)

### Manual Rollback
```bash
# Git rollback (if needed)
git revert [commit-hash]
git push origin main
# Vercel redeploys previous version

# Partial rollback (specific files)
git checkout HEAD~1 [file-path]
git commit -m "fix: revert specific file"
git push origin main
```

### Rollback SLA
- **Critical issues:** Rollback within 15 minutes
- **High severity:** Rollback within 30 minutes
- **Medium severity:** Assess for hotfix vs rollback
- **Low severity:** Continue with monitoring

---

## Monitoring & Metrics

### Real-Time Monitoring (24 Hours Post-Launch)
- **Every 5 minutes:** Uptime, error rate, page load time
- **Every 30 minutes:** Lighthouse score, Web Vitals, API response time
- **Every 2 hours:** Full health audit including database performance

### Tools & Services
1. **Vercel Analytics** (built-in) — Real-time metrics, edge performance
2. **Google Analytics 4** — User behavior, event tracking
