# Repository Standardization and Governance Program

This document defines a **practical, rollout-ready** program to standardize repositories, improve documentation quality, enforce codebase hygiene, and sustain governance **without** unnecessary friction for product teams. Deeper standards live in linked modules under [`docs/standards/`](./).

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| [repo-taxonomy.md](./repo-taxonomy.md) | Category-specific mandatory vs optional controls |
| [documentation-rubric.md](./documentation-rubric.md) | Doc quality rubric and review guidance |
| [hygiene-baseline.md](./hygiene-baseline.md) | Required vs recommended hygiene controls |
| [migration-framework.md](./migration-framework.md) | Assessment, prioritization, checklist, scorecard |
| [automation-enforcement.md](./automation-enforcement.md) | Automation catalog, severity ramp, remediation |

---

## Executive summary

### Purpose

Engineering organizations compound **operational entropy** when every team invents its own repository shape, documentation style, CI contract, and ownership model. This initiative establishes a **small set of global baselines**, **clear exceptions**, and **progressive automation** so teams ship faster with less surprise—incidents, audits, and onboarding included.

### Business and engineering benefits

| Benefit | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| Faster time-to-productivity | Predictable README, dev setup, and ownership pointers |
| Fewer production incidents | Branch protection, secret scanning, dependency freshness SLOs |
| Lower compliance cost | SECURITY policy, audit trail (ADRs/changelog), metadata for scope |
| Predictable delivery | Consistent CI “green means shippable” contract |
| Sustainable platform leverage | Templates + policy-as-code scale without headcount linearly |

### Risks of not standardizing

| Risk | Example |
|------|---------|
| Slower MTTR | On-call cannot find runbook, owner, or rollback path |
| Repeated incidents | Drift in secrets handling and dependency patching |
| Audit failure | Missing license, security contact, or data classification |
| Fragile CI | “Green” PRs that skip tests or break main unpredictably |
| Knowledge loss | Key engineer leaves; repo becomes unmaintained black box |

### What “good” looks like after rollout

- **≥90%** of non-archived repos meet **baseline metadata + docs + branch protection** (org-defined threshold).
- New engineers report **median onboarding &lt; 2 days** to first meaningful contribution (for typical service/app repos).
- **Exception registry** exists; waivers are **time-boxed**, **owned**, and **revisited**.
- Compliance dashboards show **trending green** on ownership, SECURITY, CI required checks, and dependency freshness—not a one-time spike.

---

## Problem statement

### Common inconsistencies across teams

- **Ownership**: No `CODEOWNERS`, stale team in README, no escalation path.
- **Onboarding**: “Works on my machine”; missing `.env.example`; scripts undocumented.
- **Documentation**: README is marketing copy; runbooks missing; architecture doc stale.
- **Layout**: Mixed conventions (`app/` vs `src/`, tests colocated vs `tests/`) with no team-local rationale.
- **CI/CD**: Different meanings of “required checks”; flaky checks allowed; no merge queue discipline.
- **Tooling drift**: One team uses Prettier, another doesn’t; inconsistent lint rules across similar stacks.
- **Security/compliance**: No `SECURITY.md`; secrets in env without scanning; vulnerable dependencies aged.

### Why this slows delivery and increases risk

| Pain | Delivery impact | Risk impact |
|------|-----------------|-------------|
| Unclear ownership | Review bottlenecks, wrong reviewers | Missed security patches |
| Weak docs | Longer ramp; repeated questions | Wrong operational actions in incidents |
| Inconsistent CI | Rework, surprise breakages on main | Shipping without adequate verification |
| Tooling drift | Harder moves between teams | Inconsistent defect detection |
| Missing security baseline | Delayed vulnerability response | Compliance gaps |

---

## Target operating model

### Global vs variable-by-stack

| **Standardize globally** | **Allow variance (documented)** |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Ownership + escalation metadata | Language runtime and package manager |
| `SECURITY.md` + reporting channel | Test framework (JUnit vs Vitest, etc.) |
| Branch protection minimums | Build toolchains (Gradle vs Maven) |
| Secret scanning + blocking on merge | Deployment mechanism (K8s vs serverless) |
| Dependency update bot + org policy | Lint rule strictness within a bounded rubric |
| Baseline docs: README sections, `docs/` index | Monorepo tool choice (Nx, Turborepo, Bazel) with guardrails |
| PR/issue templates (lightweight) | Service vs library directory layout (within taxonomy rules) |

### Governance: roles and responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| **Platform / Developer Experience** | Baselines, templates, org-wide checks, scorecards, tooling support |
| **Security / AppSec** | Secret policy, vulnerability SLAs, SECURITY.md content, scanner config |
| **Service / Repo owners** | Day-to-day compliance, accurate metadata, runbooks, exception requests |
| **Architecture / Tech Council** | ADR alignment for org-wide decisions; exception approval for broad waivers |
| **EM / Staff engineers** | Prioritize migration work; protect sustainable pace |

### Exceptions: request, approve, document, revisit

1. **Request**: File `docs/governance/exceptions/<repo>-<id>.md` (or centralized registry repo) using the exception template (see [migration-framework.md](./migration-framework.md)).
2. **Approve**: Named approvers: repo owner + platform delegate (+ security for security-related waivers).
3. **Document**: Exception lists **what**, **why**, **risk**, **expiry**, **compensating controls**.
4. **Revisit**: Calendar reminder before expiry; default **90 days** for process waivers, **180 days** for tooling waivers unless justified.

## Standard repository blueprint

Each item: **why**, **mandatory (M) / optional (O)**, **default format**, **example**.

### Top-level layout (recommended default)

| `.editorconfig` | O | Cross-editor consistency | Minimal shared rules |
| `service.yaml` (or `catalog/service.yaml`) | M (services) | Ownership, tier, pager | [templates](../templates/service-metadata.yaml) |

### README expectations

- **M**: Name, purpose, ownership, **how to run locally**, **how to test**, links to `docs/`, support/security.
- **O**: Badges, architecture diagram, roadmap—when useful.

### CONTRIBUTING guide

- **M**: Branching, commit conventions, PR checklist, how CI works, how to request exceptions.
- **O**: Code style deep dive (can link to auto-formatter docs).

### CODEOWNERS

- **M**: Default owner team for `*`; narrow paths for specialists (e.g., `/infra/`).
- Default pattern: see [templates](../templates/CODEOWNERS.template).

### LICENSE handling

- **M**: Either include `LICENSE` file **or** explicit statement in README pointing to org-standard license with SPDX ID.
- Libraries published to registries: **M** full `LICENSE` in repo.

### CHANGELOG approach

- **Libraries (published)**: **M** `CHANGELOG.md` or release notes via CI with same content.
- **Apps/services**: **O** auto-generated release notes from PR labels + optional `CHANGELOG.md` for notable changes.

### SECURITY policy

- **M**: Contact method, supported versions, disclosure timeline expectation, safe harbor statement (as legal allows).
- **O**: Bug bounty program pointer.

### ADRs

- **M** for services with meaningful architecture choices; **O** for small apps.
- One ADR per decision; supersede rather than edit history.

### Docs structure

Minimum `docs/README.md` as **index** linking to setup, deploy, architecture, runbooks, troubleshooting. See [templates](../templates/docs-index.template.md).

### Environment / config examples

- **M**: `.env.example` with dummy values and comments; never commit secrets.
- **O**: `docker-compose.yml` for local deps when used.

### Test structure

- **M**: Document where tests live and how to run **one** canonical command (e.g., `npm test`, `make test`).
- **O**: Coverage thresholds—see [hygiene-baseline.md](./hygiene-baseline.md).

### CI/CD placement

- **GitHub Actions**: `.github/workflows/*.{yml,yaml}`.
- **M**: At least **ci** workflow running lint + tests on PR; **main** branch protection requires it.
- Name convention: `ci.yml`, `release.yml`, `security.yml` (recommended).

### Ownership metadata

- **M** `service.yaml` (or registered in internal service catalog with export to repo): team, slack, pager, tier, lifecycle.

### Dependency update tooling

- **M**: Dependabot **or** Renovate with org-approved config; grouped updates encouraged to reduce noise.

### Issue and PR templates

- **M**: Bug + feature (or combined with sections); PR template with risk/test checklist.
- Keep templates **short** to reduce friction.

## Rollout strategy

| Phase | Goals | Activities | Owners | Success criteria | Risks | Comms |
|-------|-------|------------|--------|------------------|-------|-------|
| **Pilot** (4–6 weeks) | Prove baselines + tooling on 5–15 repos | Templates, org checks as **warning**, office hours | Platform + pilot teams | Pilot scorecard ≥ target; feedback incorporated | Pilot fatigue | Weekly demo + async notes |
| **Feedback loop** | Tune policies | Adjust templates, fix false positives | Platform | Reduced waiver requests; dev NPS not tanking | Death by committee | RFC-lite for changes |
| **Incremental adoption** | Scale by tier | Team-by-team migration backlog | EM + owners | +25–40% repos compliant per quarter (example) | Competing priorities | Leadership priority in OKRs |
| **Org-wide rollout** | Baseline everywhere | Enforce **block** on critical checks | Platform + security | ≥90% baseline (threshold TBD) | CI instability | Clear remediation docs |
| **Long-tail cleanup** | Edge cases | Monorepos, legacy, acquisitions | Owners + platform | Exceptions documented | Exception sprawl | Quarterly exception review |
| **Steady-state** | Sustain | Quarterly audits, scorecards, template updates | Platform | No drift in median compliance | Dashboard theater | Publish trends, not just snapshots |

---

## Change management plan

### Anticipated resistance

- “This is bureaucracy.” → Position as **defaults + automation**, not approvals for every PR.
- “We’re too busy.” → **Phased** enforcement, **autofix** PRs, **office hours**.
- “Our repo is special.” → **Taxonomy + time-boxed exceptions** with clear expiry.

### Positioning: enabler, not gatekeeper

- **For leadership**: Predictable risk posture and faster onboarding ROI.
- **For managers**: Less firefighting; clearer ownership; measurable progress.
- **For developers**: Less guesswork; templates; CI that means something.

### Reduce migration burden

- Cookiecutter / internal CLI to scaffold missing files  
- Bulk “compliance PR” bot opening fixes  
- Exception process that is **fast** for low-risk cases  

---

## Migration framework

See **[migration-framework.md](./migration-framework.md)** for assessment, prioritization, checklist, and **repo audit scorecard**.

---

## Success metrics

### Leading indicators (early signals)

| KPI | Definition |
|-----|------------|
| Template adoption % | Repos created from org template or with equivalent files |
| Metadata completeness | `service.yaml` + CODEOWNERS valid |
| Doc presence | Required `docs/` sections exist |
| CI warning clearance | Warnings trending down week over week |
| Exception count / cap | Waivers stable or decreasing as % of repos |

### Lagging indicators (outcomes)

| KPI | Definition |
|-----|------------|
| Onboarding time | Survey + optional CLI telemetry “time to first PR” |
| Incident MTTR | Correlated with runbook/ownership completeness (sample) |
| Broken main rate | Reverts / hotfixes traceable to missing checks |
| Audit pass rate | Internal or external audit checklist |
| Dependency freshness | Mean age of critical CVE patches |

---

## Risks and tradeoffs

| Failure mode | Mitigation |
|--------------|------------|
| Too strict too fast | Warning → block ramp; pilot first |
| Exception sprawl | Quarterly review; expiry mandatory |
| Scorecard gaming | Spot audits + qualitative doc rubric |
| Loss of team autonomy | Taxonomy allows stack variance; document “why” |
| Tooling team overload | Self-service templates; automate fixes |

---

## Final recommendation

| Item | Recommendation |
|------|----------------|
| **Program name** | **Repo Excellence Program (REP)** |
| **Alternatives** | Engineering Repository Standard (ERS); Baseline & Ownership Standard (BOS); Unified Repo Framework (URF); GitHub Hygiene & Metadata (GHM); Standard Repository Initiative (SRI) |
| **One-sentence roadmap description** | Establish org-wide repository baselines, templates, and progressive automation to accelerate delivery and reduce operational risk without blocking teams. |
| **Internal announcement blurb** | We’re rolling out **Repo Excellence Program (REP)**: shared templates, clear ownership metadata, and lightweight CI/docs standards—starting as warnings, moving to guardrails—so every repo is easy to onboard, operate, and secure. |
| **Scope** | GitHub repos, documentation, CI contracts, metadata, hygiene automation, migration, exceptions. |
| **Out of scope** | Mandating a single language/framework; replacing CI platform org-wide in Q1; rewriting applications for style only. |
