# Documentation Standards

## Principles

1. **Discoverable** — Index from README → `docs/README.md` → specific doc.
2. **Accurate** — Last-reviewed date on operational docs (recommended).
3. **Actionable** — Steps, commands, and failure modes—not essays.
4. **Scoped** — Separate “getting started” from “deep architecture.”

## Documentation quality rubric

Score each dimension **1–4** and average for an overall tier, or use **minimum** dimension as floor.

### Dimensions

| Dimension | Poor (1) | Acceptable (2) | Strong (3) | Exemplary (4) |
|-----------|----------|------------------|------------|---------------|
| **Completeness** | Missing setup or ownership | Core paths documented; gaps in edge cases | All primary flows documented | Edge cases, diagrams, clear boundaries |
| **Accuracy** | Wrong commands / broken links | Mostly works; occasional drift | Verified recently; links work | Automated checks or scheduled review with owners |
| **Freshness** | Stale &gt;12 months | Stale 6–12m with “may be outdated” | Reviewed ≤6m or on-change | CI/docs lint or ownership rotation |
| **Discoverability** | README is wall of text | README + docs index | Clear nav, search-friendly headings | Cross-links from related services |
| **Operational usability** | No runbook / wrong escalation | Runbook exists; thin on failure modes | Step-by-step with dashboards | Game days updated docs; MTTR evidence |

### Overall levels

| Level | Definition |
|-------|------------|
| **Poor** | Any critical path undocumented OR misleading; onboarding blocked |
| **Acceptable** | New hire can run locally with &lt;1 day help; ops path exists but thin |
| **Strong** | Self-service onboarding; runbooks actionable; known gaps listed |
| **Exemplary** | Measurable onboarding time; docs tested in CI or drills; continuous improvement |

### Review cadence

- **Services:** Architecture + runbook **quarterly** spot check (sample).
- **Libraries:** Compatibility section on **major** release.
- **All:** After **incidents**, update docs within **5 business days** (recommended SLO).
