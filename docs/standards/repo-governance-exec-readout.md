# Executive Readout: Repo Excellence Program (REP)

## Why now

Repository inconsistency is causing avoidable drag: slower onboarding, unreliable CI signals, unclear ownership, and recurring security/compliance risk. REP sets a practical baseline across all GitHub repositories while preserving stack autonomy.

## What we delivered

The implementation package is complete and modular:

- Program charter and operating model: `docs/standards/repo-governance-program.md`
- Taxonomy and category exceptions: `docs/standards/repo-taxonomy.md`
- Documentation standards and rubric: `docs/standards/documentation-rubric.md`
- Hygiene controls (required vs recommended): `docs/standards/hygiene-baseline.md`
- Migration framework + scorecard: `docs/standards/migration-framework.md`
- Automation and enforcement roadmap: `docs/standards/automation-enforcement.md`
- Ready-to-use templates: `docs/templates/`
- Policy outline: `docs/policy/sample-repository-policy-outline.md`
- 90-day rollout plan: `docs/roadmaps/repo-governance-90-day-plan.md`
- Compliance dashboard schema: `docs/metrics/compliance-dashboard-schema.md`

## Decision summary

### 1) Global baseline, local variance

We standardize ownership, documentation minimums, branch protections, secret/dependency controls, and governance metadata globally.
Teams retain flexibility for language/framework/build/test/deploy implementation details.

### 2) Progressive enforcement

Adoption starts with informational and warning checks, then moves to targeted required checks for high-risk repos and all new repos.
This reduces friction and prevents “big-bang policy shock.”

### 3) Explicit exception mechanism

Waivers are allowed but time-boxed, risk-scored, and tracked in a visible registry with mandatory revisit dates.

## Business and engineering outcomes expected

- Faster engineer onboarding due to predictable repo structure and docs.
- Lower incident MTTR due to clear ownership and runbook discoverability.
- Fewer preventable release failures by making CI contract consistent.
- Better audit posture through explicit security policy, metadata, and control evidence.

## 90-day plan at a glance

- **Days 0–30:** pilot scope, template rollout, warning-only governance checks.
- **Days 31–60:** harden pilot, add metadata schema validation, incorporate feedback.
- **Days 61–90:** expand adoption, enforce required checks for new + high-criticality repos, handoff to steady-state governance.

Detailed schedule is in `docs/roadmaps/repo-governance-90-day-plan.md`.

## Leadership asks (approval needed)

1. Approve REP as the organization-wide repository baseline program.
2. Approve initial enforcement posture (warn-first, targeted blocking after pilot).
3. Nominate pilot teams and confirm Platform/Security DRIs.
4. Require quarterly exception and compliance review at staff+ level.

## Guardrails to avoid bureaucracy

- Keep mandatory controls minimal and high signal.
- Ship reusable templates and auto-remediation first.
- Use taxonomy-specific standards instead of one-size-fits-all.
- Time-box exceptions rather than permanent waivers.

## Success criteria

Leading indicators:
- % repos with template-equivalent baseline files
- % repos with valid ownership metadata and CODEOWNERS
- % repos with required documentation footprint

Lagging indicators:
- Onboarding time to first meaningful PR
- Broken-main/revert rate due to repo misconfiguration
- Dependency freshness and critical vulnerability age
- Compliance pass rate and archive hygiene quality

## Recommendation

Adopt **Repo Excellence Program (REP)** this quarter with pilot-first rollout and warning-first enforcement, then graduate to targeted required checks by day 90.
