# Sample Repository Policy Document (Outline)

*Use this outline to produce an official policy owned by Engineering + Legal + Security.*

---

## 1. Purpose and scope

1.1 Objectives: consistency, security, compliance, operational readiness.  
1.2 Applicability: all {{Company}} GitHub organizations / repositories except {{listed exceptions}}.  
1.3 Effective date and revision history.

---

## 2. Definitions

- Repository, default branch, service tier, prototype, archived repository  
- Baseline standard, recommended practice, exception (waiver)

---

## 3. Roles and responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| Engineering leadership | Sponsor program; set quarterly targets |
| Platform / DevEx | Baselines, templates, automation, scorecards |
| Security | Secret scanning, vulnerability SLAs, SECURITY.md |
| Repository owners | Compliance within their repos |
| Internal audit | Sample-based verification *(if applicable)* |

## 4. Mandatory standards

4.1 **Metadata:** CODEOWNERS, ownership record (`service.yaml` or catalog), lifecycle state.  
4.2 **Security:** SECURITY.md, coordinated disclosure, no secrets in VCS, dependency automation.  
4.3 **Branch protection:** PR required, required status checks, no force-push to default branch.  
4.4 **Documentation:** README minimum structure; operational docs per [taxonomy](../standards/repo-taxonomy.md).  
4.5 **CI:** Lint + tests on PR; definition of “required check.”
