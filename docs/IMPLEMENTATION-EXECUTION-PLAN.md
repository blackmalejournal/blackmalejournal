# Detailed Deployment Execution Plan for BMJ Website Updates

## Executive Overview

This document provides a comprehensive, step-by-step implementation plan for deploying all website enhancements across development, testing, staging, and production environments. The plan ensures minimal disruption, thorough validation, and continuous monitoring throughout the deployment lifecycle.

---

## PHASE 1: DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT SETUP (Week 1, Days 1-2)

### 1.1 Local Development Environment Configuration

**Prerequisites:**
- Node.js 18+ installed
- Git configured with SSH keys
- Docker installed (optional, for consistent environments)

**Step-by-Step Setup:**

```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone --branch bmj-branding-strategy git@github.com:blackmalejournal/blackmalejournal.git
cd blackmalejournal

# 2. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/website-enhancements-v2.0
git pull origin bmj-branding-strategy

# 3. Install dependencies
npm install
# OR
yarn install
# OR
pnpm install

# 4. Verify build
npm run build

# 5. Start development server
npm run dev
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✓ Build successful (0 errors, 0 warnings)
✓ Dev server running on http://localhost:3000
✓ All CSS animations rendering smoothly
```

### 1.2 Environment Variables Verification

**Create `.env.local` with:**
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID=<your-ga-id>
NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_ENV=development
DATABASE_URL=<local-or-staging-db>
```

### 1.3 Feature Branch Naming Convention

```
feature/branding-enhancements-v2-{date}
└─ Example: feature/branding-enhancements-v2-2026-04-09

Naming scheme: {type}/{feature}-{version}-{date}
Types: feature, bugfix, enhancement, refactor
```

---

## PHASE 2: COMPREHENSIVE TESTING STRATEGY (Week 1-2, Days 3-8)

### 2.1 Unit Testing

**CSS Animation Tests:**
```bash
npm run test:css-animations

# Test suites:
# ✓ Transition classes render correctly
# ✓ Hover states trigger smoothly
# ✓ Animation keyframes complete without errors
# ✓ Responsive breakpoints apply correctly
```

**Component Tests:**
```bash
npm run test:components

# Coverage targets:
# - 90%+ line coverage for UI components
# - 100% critical paths (buttons, navigation)
# - All state transitions validated
```

### 2.2 Browser & Device Testing Matrix

**Desktop Browsers:**
| Browser | Version | Status | Notes |
|---------|---------|--------|-------|
| Chrome | Latest | PASS | Primary target |
| Firefox | Latest | PASS | Secondary target |
| Safari | 15+ | PASS | macOS compatibility |
| Edge | Latest | PASS | Windows compatibility |

**Mobile Devices:**
| Device | Resolution | iOS/Android | Status |
|--------|-----------|-------------|--------|
| iPhone 14 | 390x844 | iOS 16+ | PASS |
| iPhone SE | 375x667 | iOS 15+ | PASS |
| Pixel 6 | 412x915 | Android 12+ | PASS |
| iPad Pro | 1024x1366 | iOS 15+ | PASS |
| Samsung Galaxy | 360x800 | Android 11+ | PASS |

**Testing Tools:**
```bash
# Cross-browser testing
npm run test:browsers

# Automated screenshot comparison
npm run test:visual-regression

# Device emulation
npm run test:mobile-devices

# Accessibility testing
npm run test:a11y
```

**Expected Results:**
- All animations render at 60fps
- No console errors or warnings
- Touch targets minimum 48px on mobile
- Color contrast ratios meet WCAG AA standard
- Focus rings visible on all interactive elements

### 2.3 Performance Testing

```bash
# Lighthouse audit
npm run audit:lighthouse

Expected scores:
- Performance: 90+
- Accessibility: 95+

- SEO: 95+

# Bundle size analysis
npm run analyze:bundle

Expected size:
- CSS: <50KB gzipped
- JS: <150KB gzipped
- Total: <200KB gzipped
```

### 2.4 Accessibility Testing

```bash
# WCAG 2.1 compliance check
npm run test:wcag

# Test suite:
# ✓ Color contrast ratios (4.5:1 for text, 3:1 for graphics)
# ✓ Keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Escape work correctly)
# ✓ Screen reader compatibility (Tested with NVDA, JAWS)
# ✓ Focus management and indicators
# ✓ Form validation and error messages
# ✓ Image alt text completeness
```

### 2.5 Load & Stress Testing
